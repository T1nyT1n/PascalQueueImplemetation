# Circular Queue Implementation in Pascal

A TUI application to demonstrate the operation of a circular queue in Pascal.

## Features

- Implementation using a linked list
- Cross-platform
- Case menu with arrow key navigation
- Display of the program's text interface centered in the window

## Functions

- Create and clear the structure
- Insert an element
- Read an element
- Delete an element
- Display all elements in the structure with their count shown

## How to Use?

### Compilation

Use [Free Pascal](https://www.freepascal.org/) to compile the program for your platform.

### Usage

- The application runs in a terminal.
- Use the up and down arrow keys to navigate the main menu.
- Press the Enter key to activate the selected function.
- After activating a function, follow the on-screen instructions to proceed.
- You can exit the program from the menu not only by selecting the corresponding menu item but also by pressing the `q` key. This references the standard behavior of console utilities in some UNIX-like systems.
- Almost all program menu items, after activation, prompt you to enter a number. You can either enter a number and confirm it or cancel the operation. The ability to correct a mistakenly entered digit by pressing the `Backspace` key is also implemented.
